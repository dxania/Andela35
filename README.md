## Object oriented programming
Classes to illustrate OOP using python

### Features
Pets class that holds instances of dogs
Dog class (does not inherit from the Pets class); saved in the pets_class.py file which holds:
1. Three dog instances assigned to an instance of the Pets class. 
2. Instance attribute is_hungry = True. 
3. Method called eat() which changes the value of is_hungry to False when called. 
The final output looks like this:
```I have 3 dogs. 
Tom is 6. 
Fletcher is 7. 
Larry is 9. 
And they're all mammals, of course. 
My dogs are not hungry.```

Method called walk() in both the Pets and Dog classes so that when you call the method on the Pets class, each dog instance assigned to the Pets class will walk(); saved in the dogs_walking.py file. 
The output looks like this:
```
Tom is walking!
Fletcher is walking!
Larry is walking!
```
